Hackathon Challenge 1 – Ai-powered Document Intelligence For Trucking Industry
1. Background & Problem Statement
In the trucking, shipping, and cargo industry, documenta(cid:415)on is a cri(cid:415)cal opera(cid:415)onal and
compliance component. Documents such as Bills of Lading, Proof of Delivery, Commercial
Invoices, and others are essen(cid:415)al for cargo iden(cid:415)fica(cid:415)on, delivery confirma(cid:415)on, regulatory
compliance, and customer billing.
Currently, drivers capture these documents using mobile phones and send them to the back-
office in PDF or image format. The back-office team manually:
 Reviews each document
 Iden(cid:415)fies the document type
 Checks document quality and readability
 Verifies compliance with customer-specific billing rules
This manual process is (cid:415)me-consuming, error-prone, and does not scale efficiently. The
objec(cid:415)ve of this hackathon challenge is to design and build an AI-powered Document
Intelligence Solu(cid:415)on that automates document classifica(cid:415)on, valida(cid:415)on, and quality checks.
2. Objec(cid:415)ve of the Solu(cid:415)on
The solu(cid:415)on should leverage AI / ML / Computer Vision capabili(cid:415)es to:
1. Automa(cid:415)cally iden(cid:415)fy the type of document
2. Assess whether the scanned document image is clear and readable
3. Detect and count the number of signatures present in the document
4. Validate documents against predefined customer-specific rules
The system should significantly reduce manual interven(cid:415)on and accelerate billing readiness.
3. Document Types in Scope
The solu(cid:415)on must support classifica(cid:415)on and processing of the following document types:
1. Bill of Lading (BOL)
o Contract of carriage, receipt of goods, and document of (cid:415)tle
2. Proof of Delivery (POD)

================================================================================

Hackathon Challenge 1 – Ai-powered Document Intelligence For Trucking Industry
o Signed confirma(cid:415)on by consignee that goods were delivered
3. Packing List
o Itemized list of package contents, weights, and dimensions
4. Commercial Invoice
o Product details, declared value, and payment terms
5. Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Documents
o Required for dangerous goods with regulatory informa(cid:415)on
6. Lumper Receipts
o Proof of payment for loading/unloading labor
7. Trip Sheets / Trip Reports
o Miles driven, fuel stops, and state crossings
8. Freight Invoices / Bills
o Carrier invoices for transporta(cid:415)on services
4. Input & Output Specifica(cid:415)ons
4.1 Input
 PDF files or scanned images (JPEG, PNG)
 Documents captured via mobile phone cameras
 Single or mul(cid:415)-page documents
4.2 Output
For each uploaded document, the system should produce:
 Document Type (BOL, POD, Invoice, etc.)
 Readability Score (Clear / Par(cid:415)ally Clear / Unreadable)
 Signature Count (Numeric value)
 Detected Metadata (Order/Load Number, if present)
 Valida(cid:415)on Status (Pass / Fail / Needs Review)

================================================================================

 Reason for Failure (if applicable)
5. Func(cid:415)onal Requirements
5.1 Document Inges(cid:415)on
 Allow upload of one or mul(cid:415)ple documents
 Support PDF and image formats
 Auto-split mul(cid:415)-page PDFs into logical pages (if applicable)
5.2 Document Type Iden(cid:415)fica(cid:415)on
The system must automa(cid:415)cally classify the document into one of the supported document
types using AI/ML techniques such as:
 Text-based classifica(cid:415)on (OCR + NLP)
 Layout and visual pa(cid:425)ern recogni(cid:415)on
Expected Output:
 Document Type with confidence score
5.3 Image Quality & Readability Assessment
The system must determine whether the document is suitable for further processing and billing.
Quality checks include:
 Blurriness detec(cid:415)on
 Skew / rota(cid:415)on detec(cid:415)on
 Overexposure or underexposure
 Par(cid:415)al or cropped document detec(cid:415)on
Expected Output:
 Readability Status: Clear / Not Clear
 Quality Score (0–100)

================================================================================

 Recommenda(cid:415)on: Accept / Re-upload
5.4 Signature Detec(cid:415)on & Coun(cid:415)ng
The system must detect and count handwri(cid:425)en signatures present in the document.
Capabili(cid:415)es:
 Iden(cid:415)fy signature-like regions
 Dis(cid:415)nguish signatures from printed names or stamps
 Count total number of signatures across pages
Expected Output:
 Number of signatures detected
 Signature presence flag (Yes / No)
5.5 Metadata Extrac(cid:415)on
The system should a(cid:425)empt to extract key iden(cid:415)fiers using OCR:
 Order Number / Load Number
 Invoice Number (if applicable)
 Date fields
Expected Output:
 Extracted fields with confidence score
5.6 Rule-Based Document Valida(cid:415)on
The system must validate documents against predefined rules that can vary per customer.
Sample Rules:
1. Bill of Lading must contain two signatures
2. Proof of Delivery must contain consignee signature

================================================================================

3. BOL, POD, Commercial Invoice, Lumper Receipt, Freight Invoice must contain
Order/Load Number
4. Some customers require all documents for billing
5. Some customers require no documents for billing
Expected Output:
 Valida(cid:415)on Result: Pass / Fail
 Rule(s) violated (if any)
6. Non-Func(cid:415)onal Requirements
6.1 Performance
 Process a single document within acceptable (cid:415)me limits (near real-(cid:415)me preferred)
 Support batch processing
6.2 Scalability
 Handle increasing document volumes
 Modular architecture preferred
6.3 Accuracy
 High accuracy for document classifica(cid:415)on and signature detec(cid:415)on
 Confidence scores should be exposed
6.4 Security
 Secure document storage
 Role-based access (op(cid:415)onal for hackathon)
7. Assump(cid:415)ons & Constraints
 Documents may be of varying quality
